# random-linux-scripts
Bash scripts for Void and Arch Linux that I've written or modified to make my life a little easier.

rotate_screen.sh - script for the ThinkPad X220T and X230T that rotates the screen to the right, along with the digitizer and touchscreen so they can be comfortably used in Tablet mode vertically. Run it again to rotate it back to normal.

discordupdater.sh - for the people who download Discord tar.gz files straight from their website. This script does that for you as well as extracting and placing/replacing the folder to a desired location.
